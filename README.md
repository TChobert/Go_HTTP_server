# Go_webserver

⚠️⚠️ IN PROGRESS ⚠️⚠️

A simple implementation of a web server in Go, for learning and experimenting.

# Objectives / pedagogical approach

=> Creation and customization of a complete HTTPS web server, based on the standard net/http package and the key features of the Go language:
  - Native TLS management,
  - API simplicity,
  - Consultation and use of official documentation as well as specialized articles and blogs.
  - Comprehension of technical concepts and patterns like interfaces.

=> Understading the basic architecture and design of Go projects:
  - Package management and interaction between them,
  - Writing scalable code that is open to future modifications and extensions,
  - Implement a complete and reusable module in different contexts and applications.

=> Discovering, using, and integrating Go open-source packages:
  - Using the chi package to manage request routing -> https://github.com/go-chi/chi
